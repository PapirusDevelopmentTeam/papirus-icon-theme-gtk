## Installation
-------------------

### Ubuntu and derivatives

You can install Pop from our official [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~system76-dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable):

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:system76-dev/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install system76-pop-theme
```

This will install the complete look; individual components can be installed separately:
```
sudo apt install system76-pop-icon-theme
```

### Installation from Source

You can also install the Pop icon set from git by cloning the repository, and using these commands:
```
sudo make install
sudo make post-install
```
Note that an initial `./configure` or `make` is not required. 

#### Folder color

Pop has [Folder colors](http://foldercolor.tuxfamily.org/) support that allows you to change a global color of folders or just one of them.

## Recommendations

- For GTK, use icons alongside [Pop GTK Theme](https://github.com/system76/pop-gtk-theme)
 > Window Titles: Fira Sans SemiBold 10
 
 > Interface: Fira Sans Book 10
 
 > Documents: Roboto Slab Regular 11
 
 > Monospace: Fira Mono Regular 11

## Manual fixes

<summary>For Unity users</summary>

For Unity users, we recommend installing patched [Notify-OSD](https://launchpad.net/~leolik/+archive/ubuntu/leolik) and change an icon size to 33px.

bubble-vertical-gap = 10px
bubble-horizontal-gap = 10px
bubble-corner-radius = 24px
bubble-icon-size = 33px
bubble-gauge-size = 6px
bubble-width = 240px
bubble-background-color = 2f343f
bubble-background-opacity = 95%
text-margin-size = 10px
text-title-size = 100%
text-title-weight = bold
text-title-color = adb7bf
text-title-opacity = 100%

text-body-weight = normal
text-body-color = eaeaea
text-body-opacity = 100%
text-shadow-opacity = 50%
location = 1
bubble-prevent-fade = 1
bubble-close-on-click = 1
bubble-as-desktop-bg = 0
```

Also, you can change [Unity launcher icon](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/tree/master/Papirus/extra/unity) and [unity-tweak-tool icons](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/tree/master/Papirus/extra/unity-tweak-tool). Look into the extra folder in the icon theme.
